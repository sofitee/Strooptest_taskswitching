# Strooptest_taskswitching
My MSc work (in MATLAB) on simulation models of human reaction times in the Stroop test. Including simulation runs of Parkinson's disease patients.

# Includes global variables plus various stroop stimuli blocks to measure varying reaction times of simulated Parkinson's Disease patients.
